                <h2>Lyrics </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I found a love for me
                    <br> Darling, just dive right in
                    <br> And follow my lead
                    <br> Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
                    <br> I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
                    <br>
                    <br> 'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
                    <br> Not knowing what it was
                    <br> I will not give you up this time
                    <br> Darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
                    <br> And in your eyes, you're holding mine
                    <br>
                    <br> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
                    <br> Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song
                    <br> When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
                    <br> But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
                    <br>
                    <br> Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
                    <br> She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
                    <br> I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
                    <br> To carry love, to carry children of our own
                    <br>
                    <br> We are still kids, but we're so in love
                    <br> Fightin' against all odds
                    <br> I know we'll be alright this time
                    <br> Darling, just hold my hand
                    <br> Be my girl, I'll be your man
                    <br> I see my future in your eyes
                    <br>
                    <br> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
                    <br> Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song
                    <br> When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
                    <br> I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
                    <br>
                    <br> Oh, no, no
                    <br> Mm
                    <br>
                    <br> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
                    <br> Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song
                    <br> I have faith in what I see
                    <br> Now I know I have met an angel in person
                    <br> And she looks perfect
                    <br> No, I don't deserve this
                    <br> You look perfect tonight
                    <br>
                </p>
